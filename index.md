<p>Thirty years of consistent method across design, engineering, and strategy — existing as instinct without explicit structure. Creative method drifts incrementally. Reasonable decisions accumulate into something nobody chose.</p>

<p>The Order is a symbolic operating system for creative practice. Glyphs for domain classification. A Morning Alignment ritual. A Codex as institutional source of truth. The philosophy made structural.</p>

<p>Not a persona, not a brand — a governance framework for creative identity that holds under scale.</p>
