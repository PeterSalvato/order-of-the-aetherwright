# Ætherwright Glyphs

The Order of the Ætherwright uses a fixed set of symbolic glyphs to represent core domains of creative activity. These glyphs are used across systems including sigil construction, Codex syntax, and overlays.

## Canonical Domains (8 Fixed Glyphs)

| Glyph | Domain | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `▲` | UX / Systems / Strategy | Structure, interaction logic, conceptual frameworks |
| `▼` | Narrative / Language | Storytelling, symbolic sequence, writing |
| `◀` | Intuition / Reflection | Process awareness, unconscious integration |
| `▶` | Illustration / Expression | Rendering, output, drawing, visualization |
| `■` | Design / Grid / Typography | Layout systems, type, composition |
| `◆` | Craft / Material / Fabrication | Physical work, object making, printmaking |
| `⬟` | Photography / Observation | Framing, capturing, external study |
| `⬣` | Code / Engineering / Logic | Technical architecture, software, systems implementation |

These glyphs are visually balanced, monoline, and intentionally limited. No new shapes will be added.

## Input State Glyph (Non-Domain)

| Glyph | Role | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `●` | Input / Research / Study | Reading, gathering, exploration, orientation before domain selection |

`●` is not a domain. It represents a **pre-creative state**, often appearing as a phase in Codex syntax.

## Notes

- Glyphs are used in linear Codex strings to symbolically document creative phases.
- These symbols also appear in sigils, overlays, and marginalia.
- All glyphs are rendered as **filled Unicode characters** to preserve terminal compatibility.

See `codex.md` for execution syntax and usage examples.
