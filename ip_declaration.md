_Last updated: 2025-04-08_

## Purpose

This document serves as a formal declaration of authorship and original intent for the **Order of the Ætherwright**, a symbolic framework for cognitive alignment and ritualized creation.

## Authorship

The Order of the Ætherwright was originally conceived, authored, and documented by **Peter Salvato** in 2025. This repository constitutes the canonical source of invention, vocabulary, doctrine, and symbolic structure.

## Scope of Protection

This IP declaration applies to the following original contributions:

- The naming and construction of the **Order of the Ætherwright** as a system  
- The framework of “sovereign cognition” and symbolic operating systems  
- The system of directories and structural components, including:
  - `doctrine/`, `assets/`, and any future directories added to this repository
- The terminology and syntax of the Ætherwright system (e.g., “frame,” “overlay,” “glyph logic,” “ritual layer”)  
- The visual-symbolic system of glyphs, structure, and classification  
- The philosophical stance and documented doctrine presented in this repository

## Relationship to Other Projects

This project is **independent of Savepoint.Protocol** and any other external tools or frameworks. While both are authored by Peter Salvato and may be used in complementary fashion, they are governed by separate IP declarations and do not depend on one another structurally or conceptually.

- **Savepoint.Protocol**: cognitive tracking system for insight capture  
- **Order of the Ætherwright**: symbolic system and philosophical doctrine  
- No integration is required; each project may stand alone.

## Usage and Derivatives

This repository is intended as a **philosophical framework**, not a product or commercial tool. It may be studied, forked, and adapted for personal or educational use, subject to the conditions in `LICENSE.md`.

- Derivative systems or symbolic offshoots should credit the source.  
- Commercial use of the name, symbols, or codex must seek explicit permission.  
- Any association with religious, conspiratorial, or political ideologies is explicitly disclaimed.

## Licensing

This project is licensed under the terms specified in `LICENSE.md`.  
That file governs reuse, modification, and derivative works.

## Legal Position

This repository documents original intellectual and symbolic work protected under applicable copyright and IP law. The language, structure, doctrine, and symbolic system are considered authored expressions and preserved accordingly.
