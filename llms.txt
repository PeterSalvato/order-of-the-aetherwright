# Order of the Ætherwright

> A symbolic operating system for creative practice. Glyphs, ritual, codex.

## About

Thirty years of consistent method across design, engineering, and strategy — existing as instinct without explicit structure. Creative method drifts incrementally through drift, not catastrophe.

The Order is a symbolic operating system: glyphs for domain classification (red = logic/principle, green = expression/craft, blue = utility/function), a Morning Alignment ritual for daily grounding, and a Codex as institutional source of truth. Not a persona. A governance framework that holds creative identity under scale.

The glyph system governs Peter Salvato's entire portfolio. The framework now holds itself explicitly.
