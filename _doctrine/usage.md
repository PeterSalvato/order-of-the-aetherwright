This document outlines how a practitioner engages with the Order of the Ætherwright — what's available now and what's coming.

## The Doctrine (Available Now)

The doctrine is the system. Start here:

1. **Read the [Manifesto](./manifesto.md)** — understand what the Order is and isn't
2. **Read [Philosophy](./philosophy.md)** — foundational beliefs and intellectual lineage
3. **Study the [Glyphs](./glyphs.md)** — the 8 fixed domains of creative activity
4. **Learn the [Codex](./codex.md)** — symbolic execution strings for encoding process
5. **Understand the [Sigil](./sigil.md)** — the visual mark and its construction logic

The doctrine is complete. You can begin practicing with it immediately — logging your creative process using Codex strings, marking your work with glyphs, tracking where your attention goes.

## Your Practice

You don't need software to practice. The glyph and Codex systems work on paper, in margins, in commit messages, in notebook headers.

Use them to:
- Label notebooks, files, folders, environments
- Track creative phases in project logs
- Mark where specific domains of attention were active
- Encode the shape of a project's evolution

Every object has intent. Every symbol has meaning.

## Your Bench (Planned)

The Fourfold Bench — four themed tools arranged as a symbolic workspace:

- **Bench** (VSCode) — space of construction
- **Chamber** (Terminal) — space of invocation
- **Codex** (Obsidian) — space of reflection
- **Relay** (Browser) — space of connection

Themed overlays for each tool are planned but not yet built. When they arrive, they will transform the workspace from a collection of tools into an inhabited system.

---

## Your Shell (Planned)

Symbolic shell aliases are planned:

- `aetherize` → enter the environment
- `fieldlog` → record observations or reflections
- `invoke` → run a symbolic action
- `sigil` → preview or print a glyph
- `benchplate` → initialize a new project space

These aliases will create a language of Work — ritualizing the command line.

---

## Your Path

This is a sovereign system.
You are not bound by steps — you assemble your own ritual stack.

- Use the doctrine alone, with no tools at all
- Track your process with Codex strings in a paper notebook
- Wait for the overlays and aliases to arrive, then install the full Bench
- Or simply observe, reflect, and study

The Order is an interface, not an imposition.
