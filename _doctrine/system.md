The Ætherwright System is a symbolic operating system — an immersive, intentional interface for sovereign cognition. It is not a productivity tool or design system. It is a philosophical framework instantiated through ritualized practice, symbolic logic, and spatial interface design.

## Symbolic Interface: The Fourfold Bench

The Order operates through a four-part immersive workspace configuration:

- **Bench** — VSCode
  The space of construction and manipulation. The Builder's table.
- **Chamber** — Terminal
  The space of invocation, alias language, and symbolic command.
- **Codex** — Obsidian
  The reflective, mnemonic chamber. A digital grimoire and exegesis vault.
- **Relay** — Firefox (or browser)
  The channel of connection. Primarily used for LLMs, research, or system mirrors.

These tools are themed and spatially arranged to create a working environment that feels like inhabiting a system — not just using one.

## The Drop Kit (Planned)

The Drop Kit is the symbolic starter kit: an invocation point for entering the system. It will contain overlays, themes, scripts, printables, and optional 3D assets for shaping a personalized interface aligned to the Order.

Nothing is required. Everything is intentional.

**Status:** Not yet built. The doctrine and symbolic system are complete; the Drop Kit will follow when the tools are ready.

## Ritual and Invocation (Planned)

The install process is itself symbolic — a bootstrap ritual. A future `aether-init.sh` script will assemble the Bench.

Planned symbolic shell aliases:

| Alias | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `aetherize` | Enter the environment |
| `fieldlog` | Record observations or reflections |
| `invoke` | Run a symbolic action |
| `sigil` | Preview or print a glyph |
| `benchplate` | Initialize a new project space |

These aliases will create a language of Work — remapping the command line as ritual, not just function.

**Status:** Not yet implemented.

---

## Tactile & Printable Tools (Planned)

In addition to digital overlays, the Order will provide:

- Printable journaling sheets
- Glyph stamp files for 3D printing
- Labelable debossing marks

These bridge the symbolic system into the physical world — ritual through contact.

**Status:** Not yet produced. Asset templates are planned.

## What Exists Now

- **Doctrine:** Complete symbolic and philosophical framework (10 documents)
- **Glyph system:** 8 fixed domain glyphs + 1 input state, fully specified
- **Codex syntax:** Symbolic execution language, documented with examples
- **Sigil:** Visual mark with full construction and positional logic
- **IP protection:** License, declaration, authorship timestamped

The doctrine defines the system. The tools will instantiate it.
